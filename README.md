# ThatTrackThough

That Track Though is a simple PHP, HTML and CSS project that we created for our course. For this project we have used Musixmatch API to fetch data from the Musixmatch Repository. We chose music as our project's theme because we're both very passionate about music and share equal and immense love for it.

# Instructions

* Get a Musixmatch API Key from [Musixmatch](https://developer.musixmatch.com).
* Enter the Key in the three files:
  * artistsearch.php
  * topsongs.php
  * topartist.php
* That's pretty much it, you're good to go!

# Functions

* The first option let's the user search for an artist's details. This includes the following:
  * Name
  * Country (Returned as a 2-digit country code)
  * Rating (out of 100)
  * Genre
  * Twitter profile, if they have one.
* The second option let's the user get a list of n (1-100) top artists on a per-country basis.
* The third option, let's the user get a list of n (1-100) top tracks on a per-country basis.
