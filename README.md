# ThatTrackThough
That Track Though is a simple PHP, HTML and CSS project that we created for our course. For this project we have used Musixmatch API to fetch data from the Musixmatch Repository. This project is not for commercial purposes. We chose music as our project's theme because we're both very passionate about music and share equal and immense love for it.
